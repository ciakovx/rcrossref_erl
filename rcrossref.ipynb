Furthermore, by interacting with R in this notebook, you will be able to execute code that I have already written, and see explanations of it first hand. Because this is such a brief session, we cannot go into detail about learning the R language, but I have provided some resources at the end of this document.\n\nIf you plan on using `rcrossref` more extensively, I would recommend downloading R and R Studio. Also, the Crossref team encourages requests with appropriate contact information, and will forward you to a dedicated API cluster for improved performance when you share your email with them. We cannot do that in this notebook, but you can do that in R.\n\nFor a more detailed walkthrough of this entire lesson, including instructions for downloading R and R Studio, sharing your email with Crossref, and much more, please visit the set of tutorials at https://ciakovx.github.io/fsci_syllabus.html.\n\n# Licensing\n\nThis walkthrough is distributed under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) License). \n\n\n<div>\n    <br />\n    <img src=\"images/ccby.png\" alt=\"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International CC BY 4.0 License\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n</div>"

It was started by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka from the University of Auckland in 1995. They described it as “a language for data analysis and graphics.”1 You can use R to create, import, and scrape data from the web; clean and reshape it; visualize it; run statistical analysis and modeling operations on it; text and data mine it; and much more.\n\nIf you intend on continuing your R journey after this workshop, I recommend installing R and R Studio and doing your scripting there. To install R, go to https://www.r-project.org/. Click on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) under Download, and scroll down to your country. Select the download link corresponding to the city that is geographically closest to you. Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop to download the RStudio desktop software.\n\n\nWe don't have enough time in today's workshop to learn much about R. There are many excellent R tutorials at the end of this document. To get help on R functions within Jupyter Notebooks, type `help()` with the function name in parentheses. For example, `help(sum)` or `help(which)`. This will provide a description of the function, its usage, and the arguments the function takes.\n\n## Writing & Evaluating Expressions\n\nThe *prompt* is the blinking cursor in a Code cell prompting you to take action. We type *expressions* into the prompt, and press Ctrl + Enter to *evaluate* those expressions.\n\nEvaluate this expression:"

We can pretty much pick any symbol, or name, for that variable, as long as it is not already a function in R. For example, you wouldn't want to name a variable `sum` because if you might end up in a confusing situation writing `sum(sum)`\n* **R is case sensitive**: It is important to note that R is *case sensitive.* If you try evaluating a capital `Y`, you will be told `Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found`.\n* **No blank spaces or symbols other than underscores**: R users get around this in a couple of ways, either through capitalization (e.g. `myData`) or underscores (e.g. `my_data`). \n* **Do not begin with numbers or symbols**: Try to evaluate `1z <- 4` or `%z <- 4` and read the error message.\n* **Be descriptive, but make your variable names short**: It's good practice to be descriptive with your variable names. If you're loading in a lot of data, choosing `myData` or `x` as a name may not be as helpful as, say, `ebookUsage`. Finally, keep your variable names short, since you will likely be typing them in frequently.\n\n"
